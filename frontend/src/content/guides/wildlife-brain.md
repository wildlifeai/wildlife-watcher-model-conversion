Once your photos are on the website and the [Cloud AI](/guides/camera-ai-and-cloud-ai) has identified species, you still have to *review* the results — and a busy camera can produce tens of thousands of photos. The **Wildlife Brain** is the tool that makes that review fast.

## What it does

The Wildlife Brain looks at how the animals in your photos **look**, and groups visually similar ones together. It works from an AI "fingerprint" of each animal, so it can tell that two photos show the same kind of critter even when the file names, times, and locations are completely different.

Importantly, it does **not** name species — that's the Cloud AI's job. The Wildlife Brain is a **curation tool**: it organises your data so you can confirm, correct, and explore it in a fraction of the time.

## Three ways you'll use it

- **Clusters** — the Wildlife Brain sorts your animals into groups of look-alikes. Open a cluster, check it's all one species, and **confirm the whole group at once** instead of labelling photo by photo. Mixed group? Split off the odd ones.
- **Find similar** — from any one animal, jump straight to every other photo that looks like it. Great for pulling together all the sightings of the same individual or the same species.
- **Map** — a visual scatter (a "UMAP") of your entire dataset, where similar animals sit near each other. Handy for spotting patterns, outliers, and anything the automatic labels missed.

## How to run it

Open the **Clusters** page for a deployment and choose **🧠 Run Wildlife Brain**. It processes in the background (you can keep working and track it in **Processing history**); when it finishes, your clusters, the map, and *find similar* are ready. You can also turn it on at upload time with the **Run AI analysis + Wildlife Brain** option.

> The Wildlife Brain needs images that are already on the website, so run it after your photos have uploaded and the Cloud AI has processed them.

## The three tools, together

| Tool | Where | What it gives you |
|---|---|---|
| **Camera AI** (your project's *Species Brain*) | on the camera, in the field | an instant flag for your target species |
| **Cloud AI** | website, on upload | accurate species identification |
| **Wildlife Brain** | website, on demand | groups of look-alikes to review fast |

Camera AI and Cloud AI answer *"what is it?"*; the Wildlife Brain answers *"what else looks like this?"* — and a person always has the final say. For how the first two work together, see [How Wildlife Watcher's AIs work together](/guides/camera-ai-and-cloud-ai).
